As you're here, then you must be looking for me â€“ I'm _David Murphy_ by the way. You may know me as Dave, or as [Schwuk](https://schwuk.com).

I am a husband, father, developer, author, school governor, and organiser of [Code Cumbria](http://codecumbria.org).

You'll find me in all the usual places online: [GitHub](https://github.com/schwuk/); [Facebook](http://facebook.com/schwuk); and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/schwuk). I also write here _occasionally_.
